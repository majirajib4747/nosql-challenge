I had uploaded 3 Jupyter Notebook for this challenge 1 is for JSON Import to Mongo DB. Another 2 from Stateter Code. As I am using my Office Laptop for this work. I had to use diiferent Connection String ( Which I got from Mongo DB Atlas). 
Also Resource Folder was too big to upload to Git. So I had to Zip it and upload.
